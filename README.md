# ðŸ¤– AI Syllabus Explainer

This project aims to create a web application that helps users understand and 
explore the content of an AI syllabus.  It provides a user-friendly interface 
to navigate through topics, concepts, and assignments, making it easier to 
grasp the overall structure and learning objectives of an AI course.  The 
application is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing for easy 
integration of various syllabus formats and content types.  Future 
enhancements may include interactive elements, such as quizzes and progress 
tracking.


## Features

*   User-friendly interface for navigating AI syllabus content.
*   Clear presentation of topics, concepts, and assignments.
*   Easy integration with various syllabus formats.
*   (Future) Interactive elements such as quizzes and progress tracking.


## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/inevitablegs/AI-Syllabus-Explainer
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd AI-Syllabus-Explainer
    ```

3.  Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  Run migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  Run the development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```


## Usage

The application's functionality is primarily accessed through the web 
interface.  Once the server is running, you can access it through your 
browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.  Specific usage examples will depend on 
the implemented features and data loaded into the application.  Further 
documentation will be provided as the project develops.  For example, a view 
might display syllabus topics:

```python
# Example (Illustrative - Actual implementation may vary)
from explainer.models import Topic

def list_topics(request):
    topics = Topic.objects.all()
    context = {'topics': topics}
    return render(request, 'explainer/topic_list.html', context)
```


## Configuration

The application's configuration is primarily managed through the `settings.py` 
file.  You may need to adjust database settings, paths, and other parameters 
based on your environment.  Refer to the Django documentation for more 
information on configuring Django settings.
